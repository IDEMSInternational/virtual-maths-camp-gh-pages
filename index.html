        <p>We are now joining efforts across Africa and internationally to create a virtual maths camp experience, a collection of events and resources across different countries, platforms and delivery mechanisms with the potential to have long lasting impact. We want to turn the challenges presented by the current COVID19 pandemic into opportunities, and continue to provide a maths camp experience for students, teachers, and facilitators from across the globe - in a new, dynamic, partially virtual and fully international environment.</p>
