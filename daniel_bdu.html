    <p><b>Tell us about your experience in this maths camp as a returning student.</b></p>
      <p>It was so interesting! I experienced that I can lead any program with confidence!</p>
      <p>I was a puzzle master in the camp, this helped me further understand how puzzles work. I prepared puzzles with my friend, coordinated physical activity programs and facilitated others sessions.</p>
      <p>As a facilitator,I broaden my math knowledge and also learnt how to coordinate and organize programs like math camp.</p>
    <p>I had an opportunity to see other bahirdar university branches during the math camp trip.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><b>What was your experience from the first maths camp and why did you decide to come back as a returning student?</b></p>
    <p>My first math camp in 2019 was magical! Firstly, I didn't expect that kind of learning system, i expected the system as our current educational curriculum. the system ,however, was fun, interesting and great. before that math camp, I solved mathematical problems with their formula without considering other ways. math camp, however, taught me how to solve those problems by understanding.</p>

    <p>I decide to be a returning student, in order to make more interesting math camp weeks for other participants. and I can surely say the 8th math camp participants were excited!</p>
     


    <br>
    <p><b>Any suggestions for improvements of the maths camps, what things would you like to see more of?</b></p>
    <p>Although the camp is useful and interesting, the time is a little bit short. I suggest the duration shall extend for another 2 weeks. Also the camp is only for Amhara region, it should extend to all over the Ethiopian country. </p>

    <br>

    <p><b>What would you tell anyone interested in participating in a math camp?</b></p>
    <p>As I mention above, the camp is fun. I suggest the next participants to have a passion in the math camp. Math camp  is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life!</p>

    <br>
    <p><b>Where are you now and what are your future plans?</b></p>
    <p>I am from Ethiopia,bahir dar. I am currently a high school student, and I want to be astrophysicist for the near future. </p>

    <br>
    <p><b>What did you find most memorable? How have the maths camps impacted you?</b></p>
        <p>Math camp taught me math is not only about calculation, algorism and operation, but it is about deep understanding.</p>
        <p>We also experienced a new thing that we had not exprrienced before through fun. Since most of participants are a high school students, we didn't know how the dormitory life was before. </p>
