okay hi everyone and welcome to a session of topology
topology is my favorite branch of mathematics and it studies
the fundamental properties of shapes for this session you will need
a pair of scissors a pen tape and several strips of paper let's play a
very simple experiment we take our first strip of paper we fold it
00:01
like this as a little cylinder and then i will put tape to keep it together
i fold the strip like this and I use the tape to keep it together
now I take the pen and I draw in the middle of the cylinder
I take my pair of scissors i fold it a little bit
i cut here in the middle so i can start to cut through the entire line
please stop the video now and try yourself and see what you get out of it
i'm almost at the end of it i just have to cut the very last bit
and when i finish cutting what i got is two separate strips of paper
00:02
so far nothing weird, but let's go for our second experiment
i take another strip of paper and this time
i do something unusual i take my strip of paper
i fold it like so like before but instead of gluing it like that
i take one of the two and i twist it like so and now i put the tape
oh i already noticed something weird i started on this side and now i'm on
00:03
the other side, why does that happen? please stop the video now and try yourself
i'm almost at the end i just need to cut the very last bit and when i do so
i get not two but one strip of paper which is folded
please stop the video now and discuss together
why does this happen and also how many times is the resulting strip twisted with
itself? if you want to count the twists you can cut
the strip and keep the two sides and then slowly you
twist the strip once at a time and you count once twice three times
00:04
you count how many times you need to do it in order to get
a proper cylinder. four times. after i fold it four times i get
a cylinder. okay something weird happened. let us continue
our investigation, our topological investigation.
i twist once my strip of paper like before and i tape it like that
however this time when i take my pen i don't want to draw a line in the
middle but i want to draw a line at one third of the distance from the boundary
okay this is the result i started from the third and then i just
kept following the strip until the end now i start from any point i give it a
00:05
small cut like that i can insert the scissors and i cut until the end
this time it will be longer because one round won't be enough i'll have to do it
twice please stop the video now and try yourself and see what you get
i'm almost at the end of it i just cut the last bit and this is what i get
i get two strips but they are linked how comes please stop the video now
and discuss together why this happens and also can you figure out how many
twists does each strip of paper have?
Let's try another experiment this time i
00:06
make my cylinder i want to twist once but i also want to twist a second time
and glue it with the paint with the tape like so
and then i'm going to draw with my pen align in the middle of it and capture it
please stop the video now and see what you get
i'm almost at the end i give it the last cut and this is what i get i get again
two linked strips and each of them again is twisted
the last experiment that you can do with Moebius strips like that
is again take a strip give it two twists and then draw at the third of the
00:07
boundary and cut through it and see if you get something
different or if you get the same okay now we have played with
strips and this kind of twisted strips are called
Moebius strips after the mathematician who first studied them
now we are going to place that with Moebius crosses
we're going to need two strips of paper and i'm going to put them like so
as a symmetric cross and then i'm going to put the tape
diagonally like so and i'm going to fold the rest of the tape
on the other side like that and then with another piece of tape i'm going to
00:08
do the same on the other diagonal and here i obtain a cross
each group of students will need four crosses like that
so how do we play with Moebius crosses it's a little bit like playing with
Moebius strips every time that you have two strips that
come together you can choose to glue them in the usual way like a
cylinder or to give them a twist and that's why we have four
possibilities and four crosses the first possibility is to glue them in
the normal way the first pair and the second pair as well
the second possibility is to fold one pair in the normal way and the other pair
in the Moebius way with one twist the third possibility is to fold both pairs
in the Moebius way with one twist but in the same direction
and the last cross we take the first pair and we twist it in one direction
00:09
and in the the other pair we fold it in the opposite direction
let me do the first cross i take the first pair and i glue it without any twist
i take the second pair and i also glue it without any twist
ok let me do the second cross now the first pair i glue
in a usual way and the second pair i give it a twist
let me do the third cross the first pair i want to twist it clockwise
and the second pair i'm also going to twist it clockwise
00:10
i will do now the last cross the first pair i want to glue it clockwise like so
now the last pair i will glue it counterclockwise
okay now we have our four crosses folded and for each of them i want to do
something very easy i take the scissors and i cut through half of
each of the two strips so i start from at any point
and i cut through the middle of the first strip
of the cross and after i am done i start with the other one and i cut so
for each of the four crosses let us try together
for the first cross the one in which we glued both pairs
00:11
in the usual way i start from any point after i finish cutting the first
strip i want to cut through the other one and what i get it's a frame
please stop the video now and try yourself in groups
with all the four crosses and see what you get out of it
here we are with the solutions so from the first cross the one in which
each pair was glued in the normal way what i got out of it
was this just a regular frame from the second one in which we only
00:12
twisted one of the two i also got the same how does this happen? we twisted
it once but it made no difference! from the other two
in one of the two cases i got the one in which we twisted in the same direction
we got two untwisted pairs like frames but now they only have two edges
instead of four sorry one is untwisted and the other one
is actually twisted and for the last case in which we
twisted the strips in the opposite direction we actually got two little hearts
linked together isn't it romantic?? a part of topology deals with
mathematical explanations and proofs about why this happens
and also deals with more complicated objects
00:13
which lead in spaces that are more than three dimensions
okay this was it i hope you enjoyed and enjoy the rest of your Virtual MathCamp! ciao!
