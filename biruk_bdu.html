    <p><b>Tell us about your experience in this maths camp as a returning student.</b></p>
    <p>I got the information for facilitating mathcamp was 4 days left that  mathcamp is going to  begin. So when I arrive, all the other facilitators were almost finish their work and I was helping the rest things  like solving puzzles and manage physical activities.</p>
    <p>There was a good time for me to know how to sacrifice for others to make them happy. I don’t facilitate any others programs before mathcamp , so it’s good for me to get more abilities to facilitate and lead other things .Thank you</p>
    
    <br>
    <p><b>What was your experience from the first maths camp and why did you decide to come back as a returning student?</b></p>

    <p>I participated in the 2019 mathcamp and It was so different than I expected. I expected that there will be “chalk and talk” program. But when I got into it, it’s unique and I asked my self "why our school don’t teach us like this?". If all schools learning technique is the same as mathcamp I think all students would have the same grade in their school time.
    And now in 2021, I get a text for the 2021 mathcamp to facilitate and then I decided to help the new comers to get what I got in my mathcamp.</p>
     


    <br>
    <p><b>Any suggestions for improvements of the maths camps, what things would you like to see more of?</b></p>
    <p>I don’t see any problems but I think mathcamp should be spread all over the other regions in Ethiopia otherthan Bahirdar.</p>

    <br>

    <p><b>What would you tell anyone interested in participating in a math camp?</b></p>
    <p>I want to say for students who interested in participating:"come and get what I exprienced in it".</p>

    <br>
    <p><b>Where are you now and what are your future plans?</b></p>
    <p>Now I am waiting my university entrance exam in october and my future plan is that I want to be doctor but the funny thing I am good and interested in maths at school.</p>

    <br>
    <p><b>What did you find most memorable? How have the maths camps impacted you?</b></p>
    <p>The memorable thing I got was beside acquiring the knowledge of maths, I got friendship. There are so many students that they came from other schools so we all see such a diverse peoples around us and all of us get so many ideas and thoughts that make me sociable. Thank you.</p>
